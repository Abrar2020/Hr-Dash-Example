    "## About Dash and Plotly \n",
    "\n",
    "* Plotly is a powerful open-source visulization tool that was used for both scientest, engineers and anaylist. supporting python, R, javascript develpers.\n",
    "* Before dash was introduced, Plotly users have been requesting more flexibility and more control over graphs and the widgets. \n",
    "* Dash is built on top of Plotly.js, Flask and React.js, this means that you can build an interactive web-page with plotly graphes with simple python scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions and Expectations\n",

    "### Assumptions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Team has at least one member that have expereience with python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expectations: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding for the basic elements of Dash, which are HTML and CSS \n",
    "2. Understanding for plotly graphs \n",
    "3. Participant can use information deilvered in this workshop and implement there own sulotion based on the basics given in this workshop.\n",
